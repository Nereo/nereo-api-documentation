## Create a simple Leave Request [/leaverequests/quick/]
Provide an endpoint to create a Leave Request in one call. Only one Timed Account can be provided. If you wish to create a complex Leave Request with several Timed Accounts, refer to the *Create a complex Leave Request* section.

### Create a simple Leave Request [POST]

+ Request
    + Attributes (object)
        + Include Leave Request Creation Base
        + timed_account: 1 (number, required) - ID of the Timed Account on which withdraw the absence.

    + Attributes (object)
        + detail: `Impossible request` (string) - Status message.
        
## Create a complex Leave Request [/leaverequests/]
Provide an endpoint to create a complex Leave Request, providing several Timed Account distributed among the days of the absence.

Before doing that, it's **necessary to make a call to an endpoint that will provide groups of accounts**.

### Get groups of accounts [POST /leaverequests/accounts-groups/]
Indeed, given the account type ("jours ouvrÃ©s" or "jours ouvrables" in French law), a same day may not weigh the
same from one account to another. Let's take an example: an Employee works usually from **Monday to Friday** and want to **book an absence** from **Friday** to the **next Monday**. Three main cases could happen:
* Account is in "jours ouvrables", and no absence have been booked before: this absence will weigh **2 days** ; Saturday is considered as worked.
* Account is in "jours ouvrÃ©s": this absence will weigh **1 day** ; only Friday counts.
* Account is in "jours ouvrables", but already **5 Saturdays** have been counted on other absences: this absence will weigh **1 day** ; this limit of five is here to prevent the Employee from being wronged if they only book absence across two weeks.

That's why we need an endpoint that provide groups of accounts that will weigh the same for the same absence.
**It's not possible to distribute an absence on accounts that not behave the same.**

+ Request
    + Attributes (object)
        + user: 1 (number, optional) - ID of the User concerned by the Leave Request, the Employee. *If not provided, the new Leave Request is associated to the current user.*

        + end_date: `2017-01-07` (string, required) - Last date of the absence in format `YYYY-MM-DD`.
        
+ Response 200
    + Attributes (array)
        + (object)
            + groupKey: adjGrp0 (string) - ID of the accounts group. *Needed later for the creation of the Leave Request*
            + nb_days: 7 (number) - Number of days counted by this absence for these accounts.
